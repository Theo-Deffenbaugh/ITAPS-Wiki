Simply select an action from the list of activities, and then choose a trigger to activate the action. While the examples I mentioned are quite simple, you can perform extremely powerful automation using these tools, saving you a good chunk of time daily — so you can use that time to attend to some other work or [build habits](https://www.xda-developers.com/i-built-a-habit-tracker-in-notion-so-you-dont-have-to/). Let's go over some apps and relevant scenarios where you can introduce automation to make your life easier.

## 4 Windows Task Scheduler

### A built-in tool

If there are certain tasks you'd like your PC to perform automatically, the Windows 11 Task Scheduler lets you do just that

## 3 Microsoft Power Automate

### Yet another first-party app

![Power Automate save gmail attachments](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/power-automate-save-gmail-attachments.png)

Possible tasks you can perform via the app include the ability to automatically send emails to a mailing list, automatically download attachments from emails, integrate online services with Excel to extract data, etc. I've set up the app to sync all my Gmail attachments with Google Drive automatically, which is super helpful since I don't have to look through thousands of emails to find a document when I need it.

Another decent use case is automatically migrating data from Microsoft Forms to an Excel sheet. When working with a large data set or conducting a survey, this is an absolute godsend. There are several [office tasks you can automate](https://www.xda-developers.com/put-daily-office-tasks-autopilot-power-automate/) with this service — including [automating Excel](https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-to-automate-your-excel-workbook/) — saving you a ton of time every single day. Think of running scripts in Excel to perform a function on a large data set.

## 2 AutoHotkey

### Script automation with ease

AutoHotKey is a great way to automate your Windows PC and make tasks easier. Here are five things I use it for.

## 1 MouseKey Recorder

### Record and automate tasks

![Microsoft Word macros](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/08/reasons-word-is-better-than-google-docs-7.jpg)

Such features are definitely not for everyone, but power users will appreciate how it makes life easier for computers that are intended to perform a single function. Let's say there's a certain procedure to follow when an app stops responding, and you need to relaunch it quickly. Instead of clicking four different times and spending time doing it, you can record the macro and run it via a key combination. So, the next time the app stops working, all you have to do is press a single key and watch the entire process being followed automatically.
