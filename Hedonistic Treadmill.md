Individuals once they get reviewed expect that they cannot go backward from that review or get a lower review or they will go into stress behavior.

All systems should understand this.  The hedonistic treadmill is also closely related to compare oneself against your neighbor.

The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is a psychological concept that describes the tendency of humans to return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite experiencing major positive or negative life events[2][7]. This phenomenon suggests that our long-term happiness levels are relatively constant, with temporary fluctuations occurring in response to life changes[2].

Key aspects of the hedonic treadmill include:

## Adaptation Process

1. **Return to Baseline**: After experiencing positive or negative events, people tend to adapt and return to their personal "set point" of happiness[1][2].

2. **Emotional Equilibrium**: The theory posits that humans have an innate ability to regain emotional balance over time, regardless of the intensity of experiences[7].

3. **Timeframe**: The adaptation process typically occurs within 3 to 6 months following a significant life event[13].

## Implications

1. **Pursuit of Happiness**: The hedonic treadmill suggests that constantly chasing external sources of happiness may not lead to lasting fulfillment[5].

2. **Materialism**: Acquiring new possessions or achieving goals often provides only temporary happiness boosts[1][7].

3. **Resilience**: The concept also implies that people can recover from negative experiences and return to their baseline happiness levels[2][7].

## Factors Influencing Adaptation

1. **Individual Differences**: People may have different set points and adaptation rates based on personality and genetics[2][6].

2. **Types of Experiences**: Some events, such as marriage or divorce, may have longer-lasting effects on happiness compared to others[8].

3. **Multiple Components**: Well-being can be influenced by various factors, including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects[7].

Understanding the hedonic treadmill can help individuals make more informed decisions about pursuing happiness and managing expectations in life[5][7]. It also highlights the importance of finding sustainable sources of fulfillment rather than relying solely on external circumstances or material gains[1][5].
