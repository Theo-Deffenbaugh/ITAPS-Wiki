Solomon was initially perceived as needing software moats to keep from competitive threats.  However, LLM present strong issues with [[The Cloud Removes Capital Issues]] as a major barrier to engage with Solomon. 

At a high level, this choice will severely restrict the TAM to those customers that are willing to spend capital on a LLM and hire operations to run Solomon on top of it.

Secondly, there is an issue of [[IP patents and software trolls are life threatening to our business]] as a real issue.  

Therefore, the first iteration of Solomon should work on top of today's Cloud LLM market.
