Friday is a fictional character who first appeared in Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel "Robinson Crusoe" and its sequel "The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe"[7]. As one of the main characters in the story, Friday plays a significant role in Crusoe's life on the island.

## Origin and Background

Friday is a native man whom Robinson Crusoe rescues from cannibals on the twenty-fourth year of his stay on the island[3]. Crusoe names him "Friday" after the day of the week on which they meet[7]. He is described as being in his mid-twenties, with a pleasant appearance and kind demeanor[3].

## Physical Appearance

Crusoe describes Friday as a handsome, well-built man with straight, strong limbs. He is tall and well-shaped, with long black hair that is not curled like wool. His skin is described as a "bright kind of dun olive color" rather than black[5]. This description emphasizes Friday's physical attractiveness while also highlighting Crusoe's European perspective.

## Personality and Skills

Friday is portrayed as a loyal, grateful, and quick-learning individual. He becomes Crusoe's servant and companion, demonstrating a strong work ethic and adaptability[3]. Friday is often described as more vibrant and charismatic than Crusoe himself, displaying greater emotional depth and expressiveness[9].

## Relationship with Crusoe

While Friday is initially in a subordinate position to Crusoe, their relationship develops into something more complex:

1. Master-Servant Dynamic: Friday refers to Crusoe as "Master" and their relationship is likened to that of a child and father[5].
2. Cultural Exchange: Crusoe teaches Friday English and introduces him to Christianity and European customs[3].
3. Emotional Bond: Crusoe admits to loving Friday, which is notable as it's the only such admission in the novel[9].

## Cultural Significance

Friday's character has become an enduring symbol in literature and popular culture:

1. Literary Importance: He is considered one of the first non-white characters to receive a realistic and individualized portrayal in English literature[9].
2. Cultural Impact: The term "Man Friday" has entered common usage to describe a loyal male assistant or servant[7].
3. Critical Interpretations: Modern retellings often focus on the problematic aspects of Crusoe and Friday's relationship, exploring themes of colonialism and racial injustice[9].

Friday's character continues to be a subject of literary and cultural analysis, representing both the complexities of cross-cultural relationships and the problematic aspects of colonial narratives.
