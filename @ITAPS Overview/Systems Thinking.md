Invented as a business concept at MIT by Jay Forrester, Systems Thinking is one of the most intellectually attractive, but lacks any research to suggest that it can be used for business success.  The standard textbook is **"Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World"** by John D. Sterman. This book explains how system dynamics can be successfully applied to solve business and organizational problems.

Several prominent business leaders and organizations have implemented Sterman's systems thinking approaches, though any details to show clear business success is lacking.
## Business Adopters

**Corporate Leaders**
- Former IBM CEO Ginni Rometty referenced systems thinking principles in discussing organizational change
- Royal Dutch/Shell's former group planning coordinator Arie de Geus cited Sterman as a key influence
- Ed Seykota, who created the first commercialized computer trading system, named Sterman as an influence[4]

## Academic Impact
The book has become:
- Required reading in many MBA programs worldwide
- A foundation text for consulting firms like Ernst & Young and Arthur Anderson
- A key resource for organizations including:
  - Microsoft
  - Nokia
  - World Bank
  - Xerox

## Practical Applications
Organizations have used Sterman's frameworks for:
- Corporate growth strategies
- Supply chain management
- Service quality improvements
- Project management
- Product development cycles

While many business leaders implement Sterman's principles, the search results don't provide direct quotes from business leaders specifically about the book. However, its influence is evident in how major corporations approach complex system modeling and strategic planning.
