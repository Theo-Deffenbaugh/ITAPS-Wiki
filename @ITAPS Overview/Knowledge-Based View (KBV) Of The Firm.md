It can be argued that this view was started by Peter Drucker.

The Knowledge-Based Theory (KBT) emerged as a significant management concept that views knowledge as the primary source of competitive advantage.  Some argue that this is just another subset of Resource-Based View of the organization.  

Here are its main principles:

## Core Foundations
- Knowledge is the most strategically important resource of a firm
- Knowledge resources are complex, difficult to imitate, and socially embedded
- Competitive advantage stems from unique knowledge integration and management
- Organizations function as knowledge-integrating institutions

## Key Theoretical Components

**Knowledge Types and Characteristics**
- Tacit knowledge (personal, hard to formalize) is more valuable than explicit knowledge
- Knowledge is embedded in multiple organizational elements including culture, routines, and employees
- Knowledge evolves in a path-dependent way through replication and recombination[1]

**Organizational Structure**
- Firms must create systems for knowledge integration across multiple levels
- Efficiency of integration depends on:
  - Common knowledge
  - Task frequency and variability
  - Communication structures[1]

## Strategic Implications

**Competitive Advantage**
- Sustainable advantage comes from non-proprietary tacit knowledge
- Value creation depends on the firm's ability to integrate specialized knowledge
- Knowledge integration's strategic value increases with efficiency and scope[1]

**Management Focus**
- Organizations must function as knowledge containers that accumulate and utilize knowledge
- Success requires creating systems for identifying, storing, sharing, and applying knowledge[4]
- Firms need participative and motivational structures to facilitate knowledge sharing across hierarchical levels[4]

## Practical Applications
- Emphasis on employee involvement in operational and strategic goals
- Development of heterogeneous knowledge structures across management hierarchies
- Creation of flexible organizational cultures that promote knowledge sharing
- Focus on continuous learning and knowledge transfer within organizations[4]
