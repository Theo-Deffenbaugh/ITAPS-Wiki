A stub in Wikipedia is a short article that provides basic information about a topic but lacks comprehensive coverage. Here are the key points about Wikipedia stubs and their history:

## Definition and Purpose

- A stub is an article deemed too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of a subject[1][3].
- Stubs are typically a few sentences to a few paragraphs long[1].
- They serve as a starting point for a topic, allowing other editors to expand the article over time[1].

## Characteristics

- There is no set size at which an article stops being a stub, but articles under 500 words are generally considered stubs[1].
- Stubs are marked with stub templates, which add a message encouraging expansion and categorize the article in a stub category[3].
- As of 2024, almost half of Wikipedia's articles could be considered stubs[3].

## History and Development

- The concept of stubs has been part of Wikipedia's growth strategy since its early days.
- Over the years, Wikipedia has developed an elaborate system of assessing articles, including stub classification[1].
- Stub templates and categories have evolved to become more specific, allowing for better organization and easier identification of articles needing expansion[3].

## Management and Improvement

- WikiProject Stub improvement was created to focus on expanding stubs into more comprehensive articles[5].
- As of 2024, approximately 33.621% of all Wikipedia articles (about 2,300,000) are stubs[5].
- The community encourages creating stubs as a way to grow the encyclopedia, providing a starting point for future expansion[9].

## Benefits

- Stubs help fill out the breadth of Wikipedia, providing at least basic information on a wide range of topics[13].
- They serve as "acorns" that can grow into fully developed "oak tree" articles over time[9].
- Creating stubs helps replace red links (non-existent articles) with actual content, improving the overall structure of Wikipedia[9].

In summary, stubs have been an integral part of Wikipedia's growth strategy, allowing for the rapid expansion of topics covered while providing a framework for gradual improvement and expansion of articles over time.
