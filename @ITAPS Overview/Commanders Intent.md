## Definition and Core Purpose
Commander's Intent is a clear, concise expression of an operation's purpose and desired end state. It serves as a guiding framework that allows subordinates to exercise initiative and make decisions aligned with the commander's vision, even when circumstances deviate from the original plan[2][19].

## Historical Origins
The concept originated in the Prussian military during the 19th century, specifically through the following developments:

1. The 1806 Prussian Field Service Regulations first introduced "directive command," allowing subordinates to determine how to achieve the commander's stated intent[11].

2. Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke developed the concept while leading the Prussian military, primarily because:
- Growing army sizes made centralized control impractical
- Communication limitations prevented efficient direct control
- The need to coordinate divided forces required delegated authority[5]

## Evolution and Adoption

**Early American Implementation**
The U.S. military has employed elements of commander's intent since the 18th century, though it wasn't formally termed as such until 2003[13]. Notable early examples include:
- The Civil War (1864): Brigadier General Warren's actions at Little Round Top during Gettysburg
- World War II: Major General Gavin's initiative during Operation Market Garden[9]

**Modern Development**
The concept gained significant attention in U.S. military doctrine during the 1980s when both the Army and Marine Corps recognized it as crucial for operational-level success in maneuver warfare[4].

## Key Components
Modern commander's intent consists of three essential elements:

1. Purpose: The operation's broader objective
2. Key Tasks: Critical activities required for success
3. End State: Desired future conditions regarding friendly forces, enemy, terrain, and civil considerations[15]

## Significance
Commander's intent remains vital because it:
- Enables decentralized decision-making
- Promotes initiative at lower levels
- Maintains unity of effort across operations
- Allows for adaptation when plans encounter unexpected circumstances[19]

The concept has proven so effective that it has transcended military applications and is now used in various organizational leadership contexts[22].
