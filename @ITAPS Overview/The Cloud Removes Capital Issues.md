Supports [[AAA Roadmap to ITAPS]]

High capital (cash) cost has historically severely limited the ramp of new technology for most companies.  Assuming the company has a CIO role, the traditional issues are:

1. Upfront cash cost of equipment removes cash out of the system, and must be fought for against other functions for the same budget
2. IT life cycles are now 5-7 years for equipment, which means capital / cash cost would be this years expense times 5 to 7
3. This means that the deployment of new technology is very slow and cautious
4. Proposed RoI is difficult to prove, with other functions claiming that you have no proof and thus slows implementation.  Furthermore, IT is considered a cost center with no real payoff, therefore, they normally get a percent of revenue as a budget, which has already been budgeted to prove historical services
5. All new IT architecture normally present severe Dev-Ops issues, where conflict between the two teams lower productivity

New Cloud architecture

1. Virtually eliminates Dev-Ops issues as cloud providers strongly lower Ops issues
2. Allows painless trial to show proof of concept without a large outlay of capital or hiring of operations
3. Allows for repatriation efforts to lower expense once the need has been established
