One of the partners was extremely involved in setting up resource tools in multiple companies to understand and track labor.

Most corporations say the following:

* The manager knows what the employee is doing
* Therefore, the manager can work with the employee to set up appropriate goals to enhance performance
* The manager can fairly appraise the work of the employee at review time

These labor systems were implemented because resource sizing was challenging as mangers request for resources lacked clear metrics, and less aggressive manager would not staff adequately and bottleneck the organization and more aggressive managers would ask for large resources, but seemed to not not miss a date when they said they were understaffed.  To solve this mismatch, the resource tool was put in place to simple ask the end resource what they did.  All entry was not guided by their manager.

It consisted of a simple electronic form for the most part filled out with common task and current programs, with the following two primary interactions:

* What did you work on last week
* How much of your time if you spend on these areas as a rough percentage

In many instances, what the employee was working  on versus what the manager thought the employee was working was widely divergent.  In many cases, a manager thought a program had been rolled off, but it was found that engineers were still helping sustaining engineering or addressing older issues.  

While there were a group of hyper-control managers that would demand weekly status reports, these reports were not looked on favorably by the worker, created wasted work, not filled out regularly, or did not capture the individuals true contribution.  In group activities, individuals would misrepresent what they contributed either through a desire to elevate themselves or by simply lack of recall.
