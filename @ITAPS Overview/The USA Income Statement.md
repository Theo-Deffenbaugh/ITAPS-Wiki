#### AI TAM is $11.5T dollars

The USA is like a business.  We exist to produce and sell goods and service.  [[GDP]] approximates this "revenue" line.

We also know that the [[Total labor in the USA]] is about $11.5T.  Assume that the USA makes a profit of 5% or $1.5T.

This means that we spend $16T dollars on non-labor expenses.

If AI instantly was as smart as a human, and could be placed inside a robot for free so that all humans were replaced, the economy would still require the purchasing of $16T worth of non-labor goods to continue to produce goods and services.  However, $11.5T would no longer need to be spent on wages.
#### More discussion about the National Income Statement

The GDP provide the revenue so that we can pay expenses.  These expenses are bundled into two buckets:

a. Labor costs
c. Non-Labor costs

Labor costs are either bundled into direct labor costs that is money your have to directly pay somebody to get out a product and directly scale with the amount of product that you sell.  And indirect labor costs, which do not directly scale with the amount of product that you sell.  Indirect labor is generally lumped into Selling Goods and Administrative Costs or Research and Development Costs.  In out model, this indirect, many times salaried, workforce is about $5T.

Since we know that the total wages paid is about $11.5T, we should have around $6.5T in labor costs that are direct labor costs, and are part of COGS. The model above assume that around $5T of this is SG&A and R&D.  The rest is bundled in COGS as direct labor as mentioned.
