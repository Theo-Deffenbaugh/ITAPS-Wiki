#### Summary

The model suggests that employee performance is a function of three essential components:
- Ability (skills and knowledge)
- Motivation (desire to perform)
- Opportunity (work environment and conditions)

The development of the AMO (Ability, Motivation, Opportunity) framework evolved through several key contributors:

#### Historical Development

The theoretical foundation emerged from two perspectives:
- Industrial psychologists who viewed performance as a function of training and selection
- Social psychologists who emphasized motivation as essential for performance[2]

#### Key Contributors Timeline

**Early Foundations**
- Vroom (1964) first proposed the interactive relationship between ability and motivation, expressing performance as P = f(A x M)[2]

**Evolution of the Model**
- Blumberg and Pringle (1982) expanded the model by adding the "opportunity" component, addressing the missing external environment factor[2]

**Formal Framework**
- Bailey (1993) initially proposed the AMO framework as we know it today[4]
- Appelbaum and colleagues (2000) further developed and popularized the framework, creating the comprehensive model used in current Human Resource Management[2][6]

## Framework Components

The model suggests that employee performance is a function of three essential components:
- Ability (skills and knowledge)
- Motivation (desire to perform)
- Opportunity (work environment and conditions)

This framework has become widely accepted in HRM literature for explaining the linkage between human resources practices and performance[3].
