Agentic AI represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, characterized by autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks, making decisions, and achieving goals with minimal human intervention[1][3]. Unlike traditional AI or generative AI, agentic AI emphasizes goal-oriented behavior and adaptive decision-making, allowing it to operate independently in dynamic environments[1][4].

Gartner estimates that inference will represent 52% of AI server spend in 2025 at $84 billion up from 45% in 2024 and growing to 63% of spend by 2028. However, we think that the proliferation of reasoning models is likely to drive spending faster toward inference than anticipated by the market. We think it remains an open question on how AI data centers will need to be re-architected for this shift in terms of accelerator spend w/ industry estimates still expecting 90%+ of spend in AI servers going to GPUs.

## Key Characteristics

**Autonomy**: Agentic AI systems can initiate and complete tasks without constant oversight, adapting to new situations and making decisions based on their programming and learned experiences[3][4].

**Reasoning**: These systems employ sophisticated decision-making processes, weighing options and anticipating outcomes to solve multi-step problems[6][8].

**Adaptability**: Agentic AI can adjust its strategies based on feedback and changing conditions, continuously learning and improving its performance[1][3].

**Goal Orientation**: These systems can understand complex instructions, set appropriate goals, and work towards achieving them through a series of actions[4][6].

## How It Works

Agentic AI operates through a complex network of autonomous software components or "agents" that collaborate to tackle complex tasks[3]. The process typically involves four main steps:

1. **Perceive**: Gathering and processing data from various sources[8].
2. **Reason**: Using large language models as orchestrators to understand tasks and generate solutions[8].
3. **Act**: Executing tasks through integration with external tools and software[8].
4. **Learn**: Continuously improving through feedback loops and reinforcement learning[3][8].

## Applications and Impact

Agentic AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries:

- **Finance and Shared Services**: Automating complex workflows, enhancing decision-making processes, and improving operational efficiency[2].
- **Healthcare**: Monitoring patient data, adjusting treatment recommendations, and providing real-time feedback to clinicians[5].
- **Customer Service**: Offering personalized and responsive experiences at scale, with AI agents capable of inferring customer intent and predicting needs[7].
- **Marketing**: Managing campaigns autonomously, continuously monitoring performance and optimizing strategies without constant human input[5].

## Comparison with Other AI Paradigms

|Feature|Agentic AI|Generative AI|Traditional AI|
|--|--|--|--|
|Primary Function|Goal-oriented action & decision-making|Content generation|Task automation|
|Autonomy|High|Variable|Low|
|Learning|Reinforced learning|Data-driven learning|Predefined rules|
|Adaptability|Highly adaptable|Limited adaptability|Minimal adaptability|[6]

Agentic AI represents a significant leap forward in AI capabilities, combining the versatility of large language models with the precision of traditional programming to create systems that can operate with near-human cognition in many areas[5][7].
