The [[AMO (Ability, Motivation, Opportunity) framework]] can be summarized as employees potential in a series of questions.

1. What knowledge do they bring to the job without learning
2. What is their ability to process knowledge
3. What is their ability to learn new knowledge
4. What opportunity does the job present to use the above
5. What is their personality like, or what they call motivation

While the AMO is powerful, it does not leverage a clear path of personality, which is critical in managing employees and tailoring their job.

### Development of the Big Five

The development of the Big Five personality traits can be traced through several key stages:

1. **Early Research**: 
   - The foundation of the Big Five began with early research into trait psychology. In the 1930s, Gordon Allport and Henry Odbert created a list of trait-descriptive terms, which laid the groundwork for future research.

2. **Factor Analysis**: 
   - In the 1940s and 1950s, Raymond Cattell used factor analysis to reduce the list of traits to 16 factors, which later evolved into the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF).

3. **Emergence of the Big Five**: 
   - In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers like Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal reanalyzed existing data and found consistent support for five broad factors. 
   - By the 1980s, Paul Costa and Robert McCrae further refined these dimensions and developed the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI), which popularized the Big Five model.

4. **Empirical Support**: 
   - Over the years, extensive research and empirical studies have validated the Big Five as a robust and reliable framework for understanding personality. The model is widely used in psychology, human resources, and various applied settings.

The Big Five personality traits provide a comprehensive framework for understanding human behavior and individual differences. Their development through rigorous research and factor analysis has made them a cornerstone of modern personality psychology.
