In support of [[The USA Income Statement]]

To incorporate SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative) and R&D (Research and Development) costs into the USA proxy income statement, I'll use the available data and make some estimates based on typical ratios. Here's an updated version of the proxy income statement:

## USA Proxy Income Statement (2024)
(All figures in trillions USD)

| Item | Amount | % of GDP |
|------|--------|----------|
| National Income (GDP) | $29.35 | 100.0% |
| Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) | ($22.01) | 75.0% |
| Gross Profit | $7.34 | 25.0% |
| SG&A Expenses | ($3.96) | 13.5% |
| R&D Expenses | ($1.01) | 3.45% |
| Operating Income | $2.37 | 8.1% |
| Depreciation | ($4.40) | 15.0% |
| Net Income | ($2.03) | -6.9% |

### Key Observations:

1. **GDP**: The total GDP of $29.35 trillion is used as a proxy for national income or revenue.

2. **COGS**: Estimated at 75% of GDP, representing the direct costs associated with producing goods and services in the economy.

3. **SG&A Expenses**: Set at 13.5% of GDP, based on typical ratios for large corporations[11].

4. **R&D Expenses**: Set at 3.45% of GDP, based on the most recent data for U.S. R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP[8][29].

5. **Depreciation**: Calculated as 15% of GDP, reflecting the consumption of fixed capital across the economy.

6. **Net Income**: The resulting figure is negative, which is not uncommon when viewing national accounts through this lens. It doesn't necessarily indicate economic loss but rather reflects the complexities of national economic accounting that don't directly translate to corporate accounting principles.

This proxy income statement provides a unique perspective on national economic activity, incorporating both SG&A and R&D expenses. It's important to note that this is a simplified model and doesn't capture all the nuances of national economic accounting. The R&D figure, in particular, represents a significant investment in future economic growth and innovation, which may not be fully reflected in current GDP figures.
