The relationship between agreeableness and business success is complex and context-dependent:

## Leadership and Management
- High agreeableness can be detrimental in leadership positions, with lower agreeableness often associated with advancement to higher organizational levels[7]
- Agreeableness has a negative relationship with income, particularly in smaller U.S. companies[9]
- Interestingly, in Japan, higher agreeableness is associated with higher income for male workers[9]
## Entrepreneurship
- Entrepreneurs tend to show lower levels of agreeableness compared to executives[12]
- In tech startups, higher agreeableness shows a 5% increase in likelihood of raising initial funding, but has no impact on subsequent rounds[17]
- Different sectors show varying optimal levels of agreeableness, with high-technology manufacturing showing slightly higher beneficial agreeableness values[12]
## Team Performance
- Agreeableness benefits service-oriented jobs and roles requiring cooperation[9]
- Highly agreeable individuals contribute positively to:
  - Team cohesion
  - Conflict resolution
  - Building social capital
  - Maintaining positive relationships[11]

## Risk Behavior
- Agreeable individuals tend toward very low-risk behavior in business contexts[12]
- Those with high agreeableness engage in riskier behavior when making decisions in groups compared to making individual decisions[9]

The research suggests that while agreeableness can be beneficial for team dynamics and service roles, it may actually hinder success in leadership positions and certain entrepreneurial contexts where tougher decision-making is required.
