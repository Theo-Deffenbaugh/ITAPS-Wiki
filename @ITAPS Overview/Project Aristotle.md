Project Aristotle was a comprehensive research initiative conducted by Google from 2012 to 2014 to understand what makes teams effective. 

These results are strikingly similar to [[Five Dysfunctions of a Team]], which give a better solution set to how to achieve a desirable team effect.  It also has strong overlap with [[Gallup Engagement Model]].

## Research Methodology
- Studied over 180 Google teams across the organization
- Conducted 200+ interviews
- Analyzed more than 250 team attributes
- Examined both high and low-performing teams
- Used quantitative and qualitative data analysis

## Key Findings
The research revealed five essential dynamics for effective teams, in order of importance:

1. Psychological Safety
- Team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable
- People can speak up without fear of punishment or embarrassment
- Most critical factor for team success

2. Dependability
- Team members complete quality work on time
- People follow through on commitments
- Trust exists between team members

3. Structure and Clarity
- Clear roles, plans, and goals
- Well-defined expectations
- Understanding of consequences and outcomes

4. Meaning
- Work has personal significance
- Purpose in the work being done
- Connection to team goals

5. Impact
- Belief that work matters
- Visible results from team efforts
- Contribution to organizational goals

## Major Insights
- Team composition and individual talent matter less than how teams interact
- Unwritten norms and behavioral standards govern team effectiveness
- High-performing teams demonstrate equal conversational turn-taking
- Teams with high psychological safety were 40% more productive
- Successful teams showed higher levels of emotional intelligence and empathy

## Implementation Results
After implementing these findings, Google observed:
- Increased innovation and creativity in teams
- Better problem-solving capabilities
- Higher employee retention rates
- Improved revenue generation
- Double the effectiveness ratings from executives
