It is helpful to contrast OKR against [[Management by Objective]]  since OKRs are used so often in the Silicon Valley.

OKRs should be incorporated with [[Commanders Intent]]

Key differences between Management by Objectives (MBO) and Objectives and Key Results (OKR):

## Goal Setting and Structure
- MBO focuses only on what to achieve, while OKRs define both what to achieve (Objectives) and how to achieve it (Key Results)[4]
- MBOs are risk-averse and pragmatic, while OKRs encourage innovation and stretch goals[4]
- MBO aims for 100% completion, while OKRs target 60-80% achievement to encourage ambitious goals[5]

## Implementation Approach
- MBO uses annual review cycles, while OKRs typically operate on quarterly cycles[6]
- MBO follows a top-down approach with goals cascading from leadership, while OKRs encourage bottom-up participation and feedback[4]
- MBO goals are private between manager and employee, while OKRs are transparent across the organization[3]

## Performance and Compensation
- MBO performance directly affects compensation and bonuses
- OKRs are deliberately separated from compensation to encourage risk-taking and innovation[6]
- MBO focuses on individual performance, while OKRs emphasize team collaboration and alignment[5]

## Organizational Focus
- MBO emphasizes stability, control, and rigid structures
- OKRs promote flexibility, collaboration, creativity, and agility[9]
- MBO helps evaluate personal performance, while OKRs facilitate organizational growth and improvement[7]

## Measurement and Reporting
- MBO measurements can be flexible and tailored to specific objectives
- OKRs use consistent, quantitative measurements across all objectives[8]
- MBO expects full achievement or overachievement, while OKRs consider 60-70% achievement as successful[8]
