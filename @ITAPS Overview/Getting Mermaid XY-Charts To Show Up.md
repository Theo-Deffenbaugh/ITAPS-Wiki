There is a bug in obsidian that prevents XY charts from showing up.

For example:

mermaid code is as follows (after the three hash marks, normally you put mermaid to get a diagram, which I don't want)

```
**

xychart-beta

    title "Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve"

    x-axis ["Immediate", "20 Min", "1 Hour", "9 Hours", "1 Day", "2 Days", "6 Days", "31 Days"]

    y-axis "Retention (%)" 0 --> 100

    line [100, 60, 45, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15]

**
```

[This produces a chart with no line]([https://forum.obsidian.md/t/mermaid-lines-not-showing-in-xy-chart/75765/4) Which is talked about in this post.

The author in this post, suggest fixing it via a CSS file.  He gives an idea, but he added in 

`stroke: #f00 !important;`

Which I had no idea what this was about.  So Copilot modified it to fit together, which I put a file called  as follows:  "C:\Users\theol\SynologyDrive\z_Osidian\Theo Obsidian 241009\.obsidian\snippets\mermaid-themes.css" and I put it into every notebook.

I just opened up the mermaid-themes file with notepad, and pasted the following inside.  This fixed the problem once I went to appearance in the setting menu in obsidian, and enabled the mermaid switch, which is automatically created after you make the file.
```

/* Affect x-axis, y-axis, line */
.mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g > g > path {
    stroke: rgb(var(--mermaid-green-rgb)) !important;
    stroke-width: 2px !important;
}

/* Affect x-axis, y-axis */
.mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g.left-axis path,
.mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g.bottom-axis path {
    stroke: rgb(var(--mermaid-gray-rgb)) !important;
    stroke-width: 1px !important;
}

/* Specific lines */
.mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g.line-plot-0 path {
    stroke: #f00 !important;  /* Applying red color to the first line plot */
}
.mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g.line-plot-1 path {
    stroke: #f00 !important;  /* Applying red color to the second line plot */
}

```

**This makes my line chart show up nicely, AI explains it as follows:**


**Detailed Breakdown**

1. **General Paths (x-axis, y-axis, and Line)**:
```css 
   .mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g > g > path {
       stroke: rgb(var(--mermaid-green-rgb)) !important;
       stroke-width: 2px !important;
   }
   ```
   - **Selector**: Targets all `<path>` elements within an SVG element with `aria-roledescription="xychart"`.
   - **Stroke Color**: Sets the stroke color to a green color defined by the CSS variable `--mermaid-green-rgb`.
   - **Stroke Width**: Sets the stroke width to `2px`.
   - **`!important`**: Ensures these styles override any other conflicting styles.

2. **Axis Paths**:
   ```css
   .mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g.left-axis path,
   .mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g.bottom-axis path {
       stroke: rgb(var(--mermaid-gray-rgb)) !important;
       stroke-width: 1px !important;
   }
   ```
   - **Selector**: Targets `<path>` elements within groups identified as `left-axis` (y-axis) and `bottom-axis` (x-axis) within the SVG.
   - **Stroke Color**: Sets the stroke color to a gray color defined by the CSS variable `--mermaid-gray-rgb`.
   - **Stroke Width**: Sets the stroke width to `1px`.
   - **`!important`**: Ensures these styles override any other conflicting styles.

3. **Specific Line Plots**:
   ```css
   .mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g.line-plot-0 path {
       stroke: #f00 !important;  /* Applying red color to the first line plot */
   }
   .mermaid svg[aria-roledescription="xychart"] g.line-plot-1 path {
       stroke: #f00 !important;  /* Applying red color to the second line plot */
   }
   ```
   - **Selector**: Targets the first (`line-plot-0`) and second (`line-plot-1`) line plots within the SVG.
   - **Stroke Color**: Sets the stroke color to red (`#f00`).
   - **`!important`**: Ensures these styles override any other conflicting styles.

### Summary

- The first block of CSS applies general styling to all paths within the xychart, setting a green stroke and a thicker line.
- The second block specifically styles the x-axis and y-axis, giving them a gray stroke and a standard width.
- The final block applies a red stroke to the specific line plots, ensuring they are visually distinct.
