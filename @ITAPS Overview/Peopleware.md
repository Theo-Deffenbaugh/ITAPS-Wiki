**Peopleware** is a term that refers to the human aspect of software development and technology. It encompasses the role of people in the development, use, and management of computer systems. Unlike hardware and software, peopleware focuses on the human elements such as developer productivity, teamwork, group dynamics, project management, and organizational culture.

The term was first coined by Peter G. Neumann in 1977 and later popularized by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister in their 1987 book "Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams". It highlights the importance of human factors in the success of technology projects and emphasizes that people are a critical component of any technological system.
