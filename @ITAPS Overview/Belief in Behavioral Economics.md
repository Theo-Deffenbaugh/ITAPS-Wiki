**Behavioral economics** is a field of study that blends insights from psychology with traditional economic theory to understand how individuals actually make decisions in real-world situations. Unlike classical economics, which assumes that people are rational agents who always make decisions to maximize their utility, behavioral economics acknowledges that human behavior is often irrational and influenced by various cognitive biases and emotional factors.

### Key Concepts in Behavioral Economics

1. **Bounded Rationality**: This concept suggests that while individuals aim to make rational decisions, their cognitive limitations and lack of information constrain their ability to do so.

2. **Heuristics**: These are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that individuals use to make decisions quickly and efficiently. While they can be useful, heuristics can also lead to systematic biases and errors.

3. **Prospect Theory**: Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, this theory describes how people evaluate potential losses and gains. It shows that people are typically more sensitive to losses than to equivalent gains, a phenomenon known as loss aversion.

4. **Anchoring**: This is the tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions. This can affect judgments and decisions even if the anchor is irrelevant.

5. **Framing Effect**: The way information is presented (or "framed") can significantly influence decisions and judgments. For example, people might react differently to a choice described as having a "90% success rate" versus a "10% failure rate."

6. **Nudges**: These are subtle changes in the way choices are presented that can significantly influence behavior. For example, automatically enrolling employees in a retirement savings plan (while allowing them to opt-out) has been shown to increase savings rates.
