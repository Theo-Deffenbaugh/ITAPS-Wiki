This is part of [[[AAA Roadmap to ITAPS]]]

```
I King 4:

20 Judah and Israel were as many as the sand by the sea. They ate and drank and were happy. 21 Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
```
The Story of Solomon is that a very wise king was able to produce massive wealth for his Kingdom. The goal of Solomon product / process / service is to replicated massive wealth when it is run by creating a performance management system that is extremely difficult to game or fake out.

In other words, AI can help companies understand who is really doing the work, then motivate these people through reward, recognition, and workload so that they are running at optimum output.  Because Solomon is an AI agent that is used in daily work, it will be in a unique position to understand the work and the tracks left by the individual as they work with Solomon as their assistant.  Solomon will capture the individuals workflow through the organization and the impact that the person leaves in their work habits.



#### Phase 1:  

Produce a product that leverages the interest in AI technology to get a user base.  This is to be thought of as a penetration product.

This final definition of phase 1 is critical for [[Defining who makes the purchase decision]] and our sales strategy.

Discussion:  Within reason, it is probably impossible to go directly to tracking humans to help size their performance.  Therefore, it is better to have a penetration strategy to find products that can insert themselves into the value-creation stream. Once you have this data, then you are set-up to move to phase 2.

#### Phase 2:  

Serve up meaning statistics to reveal value created by human agents.  This is the real unique value add.  This should create extremely high levels of engagement as a fair system.


#### Phase 3: 

Provide a comprehensive system that allow a business to engage their employees and reward each employee to yield productivity and prosperity
