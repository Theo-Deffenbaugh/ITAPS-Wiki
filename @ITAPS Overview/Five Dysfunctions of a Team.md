This model suggests a framework to create high performance teams.  Framework is similar to results from [[Project Aristotle]] and should be looked at together.  The model should also support research into the [[Gallup Engagement Model]], which may be interpreted as another way of reflecting the model below.

| Dysfunction                 | Description                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Absence of (Personal) Trust | Team members are unwilling to be vulnerable with each other. Avoid admitting mistakes or weaknesses.                       |
| Fear of Conflict            | Teams avoid engaging in unfiltered, passionate debate. Artificial harmony takes precedence over constructive disagreement. |
| Lack of Commitment          | Team members fail to buy into decisions. Absence of clear plans of action. People feign agreement without real buy-in.     |
| Avoidance of Accountability | Team members hesitate to call out counterproductive behaviors. People don't hold peers responsible for their actions.      |
| Inattention to Results      | Individual needs or departmental interests take precedence over team goals. Focus shifts to personal success and status.   |
