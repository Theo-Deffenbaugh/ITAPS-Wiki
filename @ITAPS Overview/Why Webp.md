Compression to 1080 @ 20% quality

WebP is generally considered better than PNG for several key reasons:

## Smaller File Size

WebP offers significantly smaller file sizes compared to PNG:

- WebP lossless images are typically 26% smaller than equivalent PNG files[1][2][16].
- This reduction in file size leads to faster page load times and reduced bandwidth usage[4][7].

## Compression Options

WebP provides more flexibility in compression:

- It supports both lossy and lossless compression, while PNG only supports lossless compression[1][13].
- This versatility allows WebP to cater to various needs, from reducing file sizes for faster loading times to maintaining high image quality[6].

## Image Quality

Despite smaller file sizes, WebP maintains high image quality:

- WebP can achieve smaller file sizes without compromising image quality, making it ideal for web use[1][7].
- It supports up to 24-bit color depth, ensuring vibrant and accurate color representation[1].

## Transparency Support

Both formats support transparency, but WebP has an advantage:

- WebP supports alpha channel transparency, allowing for better-looking images with transparent backgrounds[1][7].
- WebP offers better compression for transparent images, resulting in even smaller file sizes compared to PNG[1][13].

## Animation Capabilities

WebP supports animation, while standard PNG does not:

- This feature makes WebP a versatile format for web animations, potentially replacing both PNG and GIF in many cases[4][7].
- Animated WebP files can be significantly smaller than GIFs, requiring fewer bytes[11].

## Performance Impact

The smaller file sizes of WebP images contribute to better overall website performance:

- Faster page load times and reduced bandwidth usage enhance user experience and can improve SEO rankings[12][13].
- This is especially important for mobile users and websites with many images[6][7].

In conclusion, while PNG remains a reliable format for high-quality lossless images, WebP's combination of smaller file sizes, flexible compression options, and support for both transparency and animation make it a superior choice for most web applications, especially where performance and bandwidth efficiency are crucial.
