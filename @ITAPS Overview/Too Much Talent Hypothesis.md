This is a hypothesis:  Research shows that having too many superstar performers can actually harm team performance, particularly in roles requiring high interdependence.  While the research is clear in sports, there is still more effort to prove this is true in the business environments.  However antidotal evidence seems to support this.

Here are the key findings:

## The Too-Much-Talent Effect Found In Sports

Teams with a high concentration of top talent often underperform due to several factors:
- When the ratio of elite players to non-elite ones surpasses approximately 2:1, returns begin to diminish[5]
- Teams with the highest percentage of top performers frequently have worse overall records than teams with a more balanced roster[5]
- Power struggles can emerge when too many high-performing individuals compete for dominance[9]

## Sport-Based Evidence As A Basis For Business Thought

Research examining professional sports teams revealed:
- In basketball and soccer, team performance declined after reaching a talent saturation point, while baseball teams continued to improve with more talent[5]
- The difference is attributed to task interdependence - baseball involves less coordination between players compared to basketball and soccer[5]
- Even superstar athletes like Ronaldo or Messi cannot succeed without effective teamwork and supporting players[11]

## Optimal Team Composition

The most effective teams typically feature:
- A mix of compatible personalities rather than uniform types[9]
- One or two clear leaders who can organize and direct activities[9]
- A variety of complementary skills and working styles[13]
- Diverse perspectives that enhance decision-making and innovation[22]

## Business Applications

Organizations can apply these findings by:
- Using "plus-minus" analysis to identify team members who boost overall effectiveness, even if their individual statistics aren't impressive[12]
- Building teams with diverse skill sets and experience levels[13]
- Focusing on collective functioning rather than individual excellence[8]
- Creating an environment where different personalities and working styles can complement each other[9]

Research estimates that while top performers may be four times more productive than average performers individually[15], team success depends more on the right mix of talents and personalities working together effectively.
