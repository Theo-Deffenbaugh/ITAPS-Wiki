Recipe for creation of post

Classically, posts will arise through two ways:

1. You will get a thought outside of Obsidian and determine you need to insert it into Obsidian
2. You will be looking at something in an Obsidian post, and it will hit you "this needs to be added"

Workflow for non-categorized items that have no obvious linkage

1. All external webpages clipped through Obsidian webclipper should be placed in the Clippings Folder
2. All new note that are not able to be categorized need to fit be placed into the Inbaske Folder
3. Both of these are top level folder
