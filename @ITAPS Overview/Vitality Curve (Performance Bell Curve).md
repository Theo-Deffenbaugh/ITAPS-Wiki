Welsh's frame work for leadership was

1. **4E**: The four essential leadership traits Welch emphasized:
   - **Energy**: The ability to go, go, go, with an innate energy that powers their actions.
   - **Energize**: The ability to energize others, bringing enthusiasm and motivating the team.
   - **Edge**: The ability to make tough decisions, having the edge to stand firm.
   - **Execute**: The ability to get things done, delivering results consistently.

2. **1P**: Passion:
   - **Passion**: The deep and authentic commitment to work and the drive to strive for excellence. Passionate leaders are often highly engaged, enthusiastic, and inspire those around them.

These principles were widely implemented at General Electric during Welch's tenure and are still considered effective criteria for evaluating leadership qualities in various business contexts.
