Almost all studies of emotional intelligence seem to be fatally flawed and their is no clear defined test for emotional intelligence.

In 2010,  Dana L. Joseph and Daniel A. Newman published a Meta-Study, "Emotional Intelligence: An Integrative Meta-Analysis and Cascading Model"  While potential advantages did exist, these were not authoritative.  

It is interesting to note that several studies have looked at an overlap of the [[Minnesota Big Five]] and Emotional Intelligence.  It does appear that people that low scores in Neuroticism and high scores in Extraversion are strongly corelated, which seems fairly straight forward.

In common practice, Emotional Intelligence is confused with agreeableness.  In fact, if this popular definition is used, then Emotion Intelligence is detrimental as a term for performance, as [[Low agreeable scores are associated with leadership]]. 

Because of the lack of research and the confusion as to the difference between emotional intelligence and agreeableness, this terminology is not brough into ITAPS underpinnings.

#### Joseph and Newman summary:

The importance of emotional intelligence (EI) to workplace performance depends on how EI is defined and measured, and the nature of the job. There are two distinct definitions of emotional intelligence: **ability-based EI** which focuses on the ability to recognize and control emotions, and **mixed-based EI** which is a broader concept encompassing personality traits, intelligence, and affect.

- **Mixed-based EI measures show a stronger relationship with job performance than ability-based EI measures**, likely due to their broader scope. However, the theoretical value of mixed-based EI is questionable because its specific content is unclear.
- **Ability-based EI, although theoretically sound, has a more nuanced relationship with job performance.** Specifically, **EI is a better predictor of performance in jobs with high emotional labor** (jobs requiring frequent interpersonal interaction and emotional regulation) compared to jobs with low emotional labor.

**The cascading model of EI** proposes a causal chain where emotion perception leads to emotion understanding, which then leads to emotion regulation and ultimately, job performance. This model highlights the sequential development of EI facets and suggests that:

- Cognitive ability contributes to emotional understanding.
- Conscientiousness is linked to emotion perception.
- Emotional stability is the foundation for emotion regulation.

**Emotional labor acts as a moderator in the EI-performance relationship.** For jobs with high emotional labor, all types of EI measures show significant validity and incremental validity over cognitive ability and personality traits. However, in jobs with low emotional labor, EI validities are weaker and can even be negative.

**Research on the relationship between EI and actual workplace performance is limited. ** Many studies use proxies for job performance, such as academic performance, rather than supervisor ratings. More research is needed to fully understand the complex relationship between EI and workplace performance, particularly in relation to different job types and the specific components of EI.
