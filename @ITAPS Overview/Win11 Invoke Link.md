Somebody rewrote the YAML into a batch file, which make bring up on Windows painless.

[It is forked and placed here](https://github.com/Sanborn-Young/sist2_index_files) but no work has been done to update it on myside.

I think you run the .bat file, then this will generate a .yml file that will be used to load the docker container.

I don't think you need to download the .yml, but I forget.
